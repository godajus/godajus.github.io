          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>We were instructed to produce a program with “Processing” that would change as we move our mouse cursor, so I made a trippy rainbow
            flower pattern that would change the middle circles of the flowers as the mouse moved.
            I didn't have much experience with coding beforehand, but I have to say that I am pretty pleased with my end result.</p>

          <p>We had so many interesting portfolio assignments during Design And Creativity. To be honest, I think it was the most fun course, because you felt a real connection with the teacher there. Also the competition in class would really get you motivated
            to do better in your assignments.</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>We were instructed to create a travelling app prototype, which would help you find the best route
          to your final destination. During the development of this application, I used Adobe XD and I gained a lot of
        experience while working with the program. I feel like I'll be using said program for years to come.</p>

          <p>During these lessons I had to flex my design muscles and empathise with the user in order to find useful insights for my final designs.
           I really liked to have the chance to use the Adobe Suite to convey my vision and I feel like these are noteworthy examples of my design skills.</p>
